                                Bull fattening and cattle pen fattening involves the feeding of beef cattle with a protein balanced, high energy diet for specific period, usually 90 days, 
                                under confinement to increase weight and improve animal health to obtain better quality of beef for export. Since most of the animals along the corridor walk 
                                for long distances in search for water and pasture and during the transportation to the market  they  loss considerable weight and  fail to met average weight
